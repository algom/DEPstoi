## DEPstoi package

### Overview of the analysis

This package provides the analysis workflow for stoichiometry
analysis of data from affinity purification experiments followed
by mass spectrometry analysis (AP-MS) as published previously 
([Smits et al. 2013](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/1/e28.long)).
The package is an extention of the DEP
package and it requires tabular input as generated by
[MaxQuant](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n12/full/nbt.1511.html)
with iBAQ quantification enabled. Functions are provided for the analysis
and visualization. For scientists with limited experience in R,
the package also contains wrapper functions that entail the complete
analysis workflow.
