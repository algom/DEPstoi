Description: This package provides the analysis workflow for stoichiometry 
    analysis of data from affinity purification experiments followed by mass 
    spectrometry analysis (AP-MS). The package is an extention of the DEP
    package and it requires tabular input as generated by MaxQuant with 
    iBAQ quantification enabled. Functions are provided for the analysis and 
    visualization. For scientists with limited experience in R, 
    the package also contains wrapper functions that entail the complete 
    analysis workflow.
